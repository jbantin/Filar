Filar is a simple Kanban-style to-do list application built using Laravel. This project serves as my first Laravel application and is designed to help organize tasks visually in a Kanban format.

- Create, update, and delete tasks.
- Organize tasks into columns for better workflow management.
- Clean and responsive design using Tailwind CSS.

## Technologies Used

- **Laravel** (Backend framework)
- **Tailwind CSS** (Frontend styling)
- **SQLite** (Database)
